    <b>Working principles:</b>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>Only crafts with guaranteed skillup is considered</li>
        <li>The calculation is iterative, meaning it will always calculate the cheapest way to go from skill 'x' to 'x+1'</li>
        <li>Only the cost of purchasing reagents is considered when determining the cheapest skillup, 
            i.e. the price to learn the skill from the trainer or purchase the recipe isn't included 
        (uses undiscounted vendor price for items available from vendors)</li>
        <li>The algorithm terminates if there's no available crafts for the current skill level. This means if the listed guide doesn't reach to the target level you entered you probably need to include another source for there to be a solution</li>
    </ol>
